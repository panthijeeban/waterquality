This is the repository which I'll be using for my Bio539 project assignments. The secondary data were collected from the Town office of Charlestown, Rhode Island. The water quality information from different wells starts from 2008 till 2017.To maintain the annominity, we have modified something here, therefore please write to jeeban_panthi@uri.edu before using the data for other purposes.
